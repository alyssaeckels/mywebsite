<h2 id="gymnast">Gymnastics</h2>
  <div class="gym">
    <p>I am a gymnast! I have been in gymnastics at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/palatinegymnasticsclub/" target="_blank">Palatine Gymnastics Club</a> since I was 3 years old. I compete at the optional level as a Level 9 gymnast, and my favorite event at the moment is probably floor. I have been competing on team since I was in 3rd grade, and I enjoy competing a lot. I look forward to joining the high school gymnastics team at PHS this year!</p>

<h2 id="tandf">Track and Field</h2>
  <div class="track">
    <p>I also do track and field. I started track and field in 7th grade at Sundling, and I competed many different events. In 7th grade I mainly did hurdles, the 400m relay, the 100m dash, high jump, and sometimes I ran the 100m leg in the 400m medley. In 8th grade I competed hurdles, the 400m relay, the 1600m relay, and the 400m medley. My favorite event was hurdles and I have the 8th grade girls district record of 8.89s. Another big accomplishment of last year was during the Sandberg Relays I competed in the 400m class relay and we got 1st! I also competed in the Palatine Relays with Anya Ball, Samantha Mogensen, and Caeleigh Stone. We competed as a team in the girls 400m relay and got 2nd. I look forward to being on the track and field team at PHS this spring.</p>

<h2 id="soccer">Soccer</h2>
  <div class="soccer">
    <p>I used to play soccer through the <a href="https://palatinecelticsc.sportngin.com/" target="_blank">Palatine Celtic Soccer Club</a>. I played soccer from when I was a little preschooler until the Fall of 2016. I started travel soccer when I was 9 years old, and I loved the game. I stopped because soccer took up too much time and my team was splitting up. Now I referee for Celtic's house games.</p>

<h2 id="volley">Volleyball</h2>
  <div class="vb">
    <p>I also played volleyball for Sundling in 7th and 8th grade. I enjoyed playing volleyball in Jr. High, and it was a fun sport to try. However, I no longer play because I don't have the time. When I played for Sundling we got 2nd place in the District tournament both years. Although, In 8th grade we also won 1st place in the Sweetheart tournament. I usually played on the outside in front as a hitter, and in 7th grade I was also a setter.</p>
